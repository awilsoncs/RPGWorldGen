RPGWorldGen
===========

Tools for randomly generating RPG content.


Next Week or So
---------------
I'll be building an API for random generation of
names, cities, and NPCs. Should have fully functional
generic NPCs up soon.

On the todo list:
- Add randomly generated names
- Add randomly generated quests
- Decide on interface (web vs. desktop app?)
- Add description for random NPCs
- Finish D&D v3.5 NPC generation
