RPGWorldGen
===========

Tools for randomly generating RPG content.

City Generation:
- You'll need python3 installed to run the example

On the todo list:
- Add randomly generated names
- Add randomly generated quests
- Decide on interface (web vs. desktop app?)

Next Week or So
---------------
I'll be building an API for random generation of
names, cities, and NPCs. Should have fully functional
generic NPCs up soon.

Description for NPCs should come soon as well.
